These are the files used in my current webpages.

formPP.php is the file I submitted for assignment 2. The form alluws users to enter their info and adds them to a 'users' table.
The users table was created for the last assignment as well. This form is unchanged other than styling and adding a link to the movie form.

ActionScript.php remains unchanged from last assignment. The action scipt for adding users to the users table.

formPPa3.php is the file for another webpage that allows users in the 'users' database to add their favorite movies to a new 'movielist' table.

saveMovie.php is the action script that adds data from formPPa3.php to the movieList table.

userModel.php contains the functions to support the dropdown window in the 'add movie' form. It also has a function to count the number of movies
a user has entered though I haven't chosen to display that on any webpages.

displaydataPP.php has been edited from the past assignment to accommodate the new table in the database.
